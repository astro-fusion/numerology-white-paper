Numerology Calculator

Implements Vedic numerological calculations including:
- Mulanka (Birth Number/Psychic Number) with sunrise correction
- Bhagyanka (Destiny Number/Life Path Number)
- Core reduction algorithms

The calculator handles the mathematical operations that form the foundation
of numerological analysis in the Vedic tradition.
